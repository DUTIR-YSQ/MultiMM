|                       |          |          |           |
| **Total Words**       | 145,312  | 68,189   | 213,501   |
| **Average Words**     | 33       | 15       | 24        |
|                       |          |          |           |
| Training Set Size     | 3,517    | 3,251    | 6,768     |
| Validation Set Size   | 440      | 406      | 846       |
| Test Set Size         | 440      | 407      | 847       |

### Each data sample includes the following fields:

- **Image**  
- **Text**  
- **Metaphor Label** (`1` for metaphor, `0` for literal)  
- **Target Domain** 
- **Source Domain** 
- **Sentiment Type**: `1` = positive, `0` = neutral, `-1` = negative

## ðŸ§  Model and Code Description

We provide the complete source code for the **SEMD** (Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection) model proposed in the paper. The code supports the metaphor detection task, and the key models BERT ([link](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased)) and ViT ([link](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224)) are sourced from these official Hugging Face repositories.
