## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

This dataset is designed for cross-cultural multimodal metaphor recognition and analysis, covering both Chinese and English samples. Detailed statistics are as follows:

| Item                    | Chinese (CN) | English (EN) | Total   |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Total Samples           | 4,397        | 4,064        | 8,461   |
| Metaphorical Samples    | 2,564        | 2,411        | 4,975   |
| Literal Samples         | 1,833        | 1,653        | 3,486   |
|                         |              |              |         |
| Total Words             | 125,275      | 48,768       | 174,043 |
| Average Words per Sample| 28           | 12           | 20      |
|                         |              |              |         |
| Training Set Size       | 3,517        | 3,251        | 6,768   |
| Validation Set Size     | 440          | 406          | 846     |
| Test Set Size           | 440          | 407          | 847     |

### Each data sample includes the following fields:

- **Image**  
- **Text**  
- **Metaphor Label** (`1` for metaphor, `0` for literal)  
- **Target Domain** (metaphor target)  
- **Source Domain** (metaphor source)  
- **Sentiment Type**: `1` = positive, `0` = neutral, `-1` = negative

## ðŸ§  Model and Code Description

We provide the complete source code for the **SEMD** (Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection) model proposed in the paper. It supports the following two tasks:

### 1. Multimodal Metaphor Detection

- The model integrates visual features, textual information, and sentiment labels to perform metaphor classification.

### 2. Sentiment Classification

- The model predicts the sentiment type of each sample using visual and textual features (excluding metaphor labels).

We welcome you to use our dataset and code to advance research in multimodal metaphor understanding and sentiment analysis.
